# 👋 About

I'm a data scientist & engineer with a research background and a hands-on approach to building robust, production-grade data solutions. I work across the stack — from cloud pipelines and ML models to APIs and web integrations — always with performance, transparency, and real-world usability in mind.

### 🚀 What I do
- Develop scalable data pipelines and ML/AI workflows (Databricks, GCP, BigQuery)
- Build and deploy REST APIs for production systems (e.g. e-com & manufacturing flows)
- Design data-driven tools for e-commerce platforms (Shopify, headless APIs, analytics automation)
- Optimize performance with C++, Rcpp/Armadillo, and efficient cloud infra
- Blend research-grade rigor with engineering pragmatism

### 🧠 Previously
- **Senior Data Analyst, omos media** — developed Shopify-integrated forecasting and recommendation systems  
- **Senior Expert, ALDI Data & Analytics** — designed and scaled data use cases in global buying & supplier domains  
- **Lecturer & Research Fellow** — led metabolomics and ML projects at Imperial College London and Murdoch University
