# 👋 About

I'm a data scientist & engineer with a research background and a hands-on mindset for turning ideas into working software. I design and build robust, production-grade data solutions — from early-stage prototypes to fully deployed systems.

My work spans the full stack: cloud data pipelines, ML workflows, REST APIs, and web integrations. Whether for SaaS platforms or internal tools, I focus on performance, transparency, and practical usability.


### 🚀 What I do
- Rapidly prototype and scale data & ML pipelines (Databricks, GCP, BigQuery)
- Build and deploy APIs and backend systems for production use (e.g. procurement, manufacturing)
- Deliver analytics-driven tools for e-commerce (Shopify, headless APIs, custom dashboards)
- Optimise code and computation with C++, Rcpp/Armadillo, and efficient infra
- Support end-to-end lifecycle: from idea to global rollout
- Explore and define new use cases as a freelance contributor

### 🧠 Previously
- **Senior Data Analyst E-commerce, omos media** — BBuilt Shopify-integrated tools for order quality assurance and demand forecasting
- **Senior Expert, ALDI Data & Analytics** — led design, prototyping, and rollout of data use cases across international buying and supplier domains (SaaS model)
- **Lecturer & Research Fellow** — headed data science and ML projects in metabolomics at Imperial College London and Murdoch University
